                <p>
                    Cyber security is the means by which individuals and organisations reduce the risk of being affected by cyber crime.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Cyber security's main function is to protect the devices we all use (smartphones, laptops, tablets and computers), and the services we access online - both at home and school - from theft or damage. It's also about preventing unauthorised access to the vast amounts of personal information we store on these devices and online.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Cyber security is important because smartphones, computers and the internet are now such a fundamental part of modern life, that it's difficult to imagine how we'd function without them. From online banking and shopping, to email and social media, it's more important than ever to take steps that can prevent cyber criminals getting hold of our accounts, data, and devices.
                </p>
                <h4>Cyber Aware and staying secure online</h4>
                <p>
                    From banking to shopping, and streaming to social media, people are spending more time than ever online. Cyber Aware is the government's advice on how to stay secure online.
