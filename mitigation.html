                            <p>One quick and easy way to mitigate against an attack is to have a backup of all your data, this can be done by using another drive which can store all the data on your computer so if you lose any data then you can us this backup drive to recover lost data. You can also have a backup by using the cloud, there are many cloud services available which can do this e.g OneDrive, GoogleDrive and more, these may require a subscription fee but these backups can be access by anything that has access to the internet.</p>

                            <p>Make sure you are well versed in the techniques attackers can use. A common technique used by attackers is phishing, these can be in the form of websites, emails, texts, and more, they are usually messages that seem legitimate organisations like banks, they can ask for sensitive data (e.g login details or bank details). Make sure you know how these companies would actually get into contact with you and know the company email/phone number/website, if you are not sure about a site you are on check the link at the top of the browser that you are on, your banks should have HTTPS in front of the link if it is HTTP then it is likely to be a false site. </p>
